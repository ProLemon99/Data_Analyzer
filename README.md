## Hi there! Welcome to my data analysis and user interface!

This is a small project I have been doing to conduct research and analysis on a dataset of the top 1000 highest-grossing Hollywood movies in the world.

I have also created a specialized user interface for you to use! With this user interface, you can find out all kinds of information from the dataset! This user interface is very friendly, meaning that you can easily find out what to do!

## Instructions on how to use the user interface
All you have to do is go to the main.py file in this repository, then run everything in a terminal through applications such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm or Replit! The options for the user interface will all be listed when you run the code.

You will be able to view data from the dataset, such as the average box office for all of the movies, average duration for all of the movies, and the distributor that distributed the most movies in the dataset!

Regardless, here are all the options for the user interface:

* 1 -> Show the original dataset
* 2 -> Show the cleaned dataframe
* 3 -> Visualise the worldwide sales of movies in USD
* 4 -> Show the total worldwide box office for all of the movies combined in USD
* 5 -> Show the average worldwide box office for all of the movies in USD
* 6 -> Show the box office median in all of the movies in USD
* 7 -> Show the box office value that appeared the most in the dataset
* 8 -> Show the movie that grossed the most in the dataset
* 9 -> Show the movie that grossed the least in the dataset
* 10 -> Show the total duration for all of the movies combined in the dataset
* 11 -> Show the average duration for all of the movies in USD
* 12 -> Show the duration median in all of the movies in USD
* 13 -> Show the duration value that appeared the most in the dataset
* 14 -> Show the longest movie in the dataset
* 15 -> Show the shortest movie in the dataset
* 16 -> Show the top 20 highest grossing movies in the dataset
* 17 -> Show the bottom 20 lowest grossing movies in the dataset
* 18 -> Show the most common genre for all of the movies
* 19 -> Show the least common genre for all of the movies
* 20 -> Show the year that released the most movies from the dataset
* 21 -> Show the year that released the least movies from the dataset
* 22 -> Show the distributor that distributed the most movies from the dataset
* 23 -> Show the distributor that distributed the least movies from the dataset
* 24 -> Exit the User Interface

## Thanks for using my user interface!
Enjoy it and have fun!
