    "### **Non-Functional Requirements**\n",
    "#### **Usability:** A key non-functional requirement that determines how easily users can learn to operate, prepare inputs for, and interpret outputs of a system or software application. Usability ensures that the system is user-friendly, intuitive, and easily accessible to all users. The goal of usability is to ensure that users can efficiently complete tasks without any unnecessary complexity or confusion. **In simpler terms, usability refers to how easy and intuitive it is for users to interact with a system.**\n",
    "#### **Reliability:** Another key non-functional requirement focusing on the system's ability to operate consistently and correctly over time. Reliability ensures that the system performs its intended functions without failure and that any errors are handled appropriately. The goal of reliability is to provide accurate results to the user and also maintain data integrity. **In simpler terms, reliability refers to the system's ability to function correctly and consistently over time.**\n",
    "#### **What are required from the User Interface and a 'README' document in order to achieve usability?** \n",
    "**User Interface Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** The UI should be clean and straightforward, minimizing clutter and providing a clear pathway for users to accomplish their goals.\n",
    "- **Accessibility:** The UI should accommodate users with different needs, such as support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and adjustable text sizes. \n",
    "- **Responsiveness:** The UI should respond quickly to the user's inputs, without any extreme lag to the point of being noticeable.\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Design elements such as colors, fonts and icons should be consistent across the application to prevent any confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**README Document Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Clear Instructions:** The README should provide straightforward, step-by-step instructions on how to install, configure, and use the program.\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Coverage:** The README should explain all the essential aspects of the system one by one, such as dependencies, troubleshooting tips, and examples of common use cases.\n",
    "- **User-Friendly Language:** The README should avoid technical jargon where possible, and be written in a way that is accessible to users of varying technical expertise.\n",
    "- **Regular Updates:** The README should be regularly updated to reflect any changes or updates to the program. This is to ensure that users have access to the latest information.\n",
    "#### **What are required from the system when providing information to the user on errors and ensuring data integrity?**\n",
    "**Error Handling Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Clear Error Messages:** When errors occur, the system should provide clear and informative error messages that explain what went wrong and how the user can resolve the issue. Vague messages such as \"An error occurred.\" should be avoided as it does not give the user an explanation or instructions on how to resolve the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graceful Degradation:** The system should continue to operate as smoothly as possible even when some minor components fail. For example, if a non-critical feature fails, the system should still allow users to perform other tasks while trying to fix the issue in the background. If the issue reaches a critical state, the system should give the user warnings and instructions on what to do.\n",
    "- **Logging and Reporting:** Errors should be logged with sufficient detail to help developers troubleshoot and resolve issues. The system may also need to report the critical errors to a support team or administrator automatically to simplify the issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Integrity Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Validation Checks:** The system should perform validation checks on all input data to ensure that it meets expected formats and criteria before processing. The purpose of this is to prevent any corrupt or invalid data from entering the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups should be made to safeguard data against loss or corruption. On top of this, the system should also have a reliable recovery mechanism to restore data to a consistent state after a failure.\n",
    "- **Consistency Guarantees:** The system should ensure that data remains consistent across all parts of the system, even in the event of concurrent access or partial system failures."

    "## **Part 2: Researching and Planning**\n",
    "### **Research of Issue and Security Requirements**\n",
    "#### **The Purpose of Conducting My Project:**\n",
    "As mentioned before, there are several purposes of conducting the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Goals:** There are many goals I am trying to achieve with the help of the dataset:\n",
    "> * Goal 1: To find out the average worldwide box office of all the 1000 movies combined.\n",
    "> * Goal 2: To find out the average budget of all the 1000 movies combined.\n",
    "> * Goal 3: To find out the average running time for all of the 1000 movies combined.\n",
    "> * Goal 4: To find out which genres are the most and least common amongst the highest grossing movies.\n",
    "> * Goal 5: To find out which years released the most and least movies in to the dataset.\n",
    "> * Goal 6: To find out which distributors had distributed the most and least movies from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve these goals, I will be analyzing the dataset and I will output the dataset into a table with the help of Pandas and Matplotlib to examine the top 1000 highest-grossing Hollywood movies of all time. I will identify patterns, trends and factors that contributed to their commercial success. This process will involve investigating various factors such as the movies' genres, release years, budgets, distribution companies, running time, and worldwide sales, with the goal of understanding the factors that drive the movies' box office revenues. This project will provide important insights into the movie industry, and can assist stakeholders in making informed decisions about future film productions, investments, and marketing strategies.\n",
    "#### **Why I Need To Conduct The Project:**\n",
    "Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive data that extensively analyzes the factors contributing to the commercial success of Hollywood movies. Although there are many datasets out there that list high-grossing movies, these datasets usually lack in-depth analysis that connects the many different factors that influenced the movies' successes, such as their genres, distributors, and budgets, to their financial outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the current existing studies usually only focus on a limited number of variables, such as the release year or star power, without considering the broader context of how these variables interact. By conducting this project, I aim to fill this gap by creating a detailed analysis that incorporates a wide range of the movie's influencing factors, because doing this will allow for a much more delicate understanding of what drives the movies' box office successes, and can also address some issues such as the current lack of actionable information in the industry.\n",
    "#### **The Stakeholders Involved In My Project:**\n",
    "- Movie Studios and Production Companies\n",
    "- Distributors and Marketing Agencies\n",
    "- Investors and Financial Analysts\n",
    "- Directors, Producers, and Screenwriters\n",
    "- Academics and Researchers\n",
    "#### **How the Data Can Be Used:**\n",
    "- **Better Production:** With the help of the dataset, studios and producers can identify which movie genres, themes, and elements the audience likes the best. This means that the movie can have a much more targeted and profitable production and quality, which can make the movie more attractive to the audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Predictions:** Investors can use the data from the current existing dataset to predict the performance of new films based on similar attributes. Doing this can help reduce financial risks associated with movie investments.\n",
    "- **Marketing Enhancement:** Studios and producers can get an understanding of what factors contributed to a film’s success with the help of the dataset. This means that marketing teams can make more effective campaigns, choose the right channels, and overall allow the movie to maximize reach and engagement.\n",
    "- **Academic Research:** The dataset can be a valuable resource for academic research. The dataset can provide detailed information on topics such as cultural trends, consumer behavior, and the economics of the entertainment industry.\n",
    "#### **Responsibilities of the Data Source in Protecting Participant Privacy:**\n",
    "- **Data Anonymization**: Any personal data that is not essential for the analysis should be anonymized or removed to prevent the identification of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consent and Compliance**: The data source must have obtained proper consent from individuals if personal data is included, and must comply with relevant data protection regulations.\n",
    "- **Secure Storage**: The data should be stored securely, using encryption and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.\n",
    "- **Transparency**: The data source should provide clear information to everyone using it about what data is being collected, how it will be used, and who will have access to it.\n",
    "#### **My Responsibilities in Data Privacy if I Pushed This Application Live:**\n",
    "- I must only collect and use data that is necessary for the analysis. \n",
    "- I must avoid storing unnecessary personal data to reduce the risk of privacy breaches.\n",
    "- I must ensure that the application and any data storage systems are secured with encryption, access controls, and regular security audits to protect against unauthorized access or cyberattacks.\n",
    "- I must obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and processing any personal data and I must be transparent when explaining how their data will be used, stored, and shared.\n",
    "- When presenting the data publicly or sharing it with third parties, I must ensure that any identifiable information is anonymized to protect individual privacy.\n",
    "- I must use the data ethically in a manner that is respectful of the individuals and communities represented.\n",
    "- I must avoid any actions that could cause harm or misrepresent the data.\n",
    "#### **What should an application have to be secure?**\n",
    "* An application requires many crucial security factors in order to be secure. \n",
    "* The most important things that any application should have developed in order to build basic security are proper, reliable user authentication and authorization systems, which can protect against unauthorised access by ensuring that only authorised individuals or systems can access the data. \n",
    "* Some more important security practices that developers should exercise is to add input validation, data storing, and secure encryption systems. \n",
    "   * Input validation ensures that only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, which can prevent malformed data from persisting in the database. \n",
    "   * Data storage systems help keep data in a safe storage, and makes them easily accessible to users. \n",
    "   * Encryption is extremely important as it plays a major role in securing data from attackers and other cybersecurity threats. \n",
    "* Aside from those, developers themselves should also use secure protocols and APIs, implement security testing in the applications, exercise their error handling and logging skills, and make sure to maintain the applications frequently.\n",
    "#### **Terminology**\n",
    "##### **User Authentication:** A process built in computer systems by developers that verifies a person's identity, allowing them access to an online service, connected device, or other resource.\n",
    "##### **Password Hashing:** A security process that turns a password into a short string of letters and numbers using an encryption algorithm. This process prevents cybercriminals from gaining access to people's passwords if a website is hacked.\n",
    "##### **Encryption:** A process that scrambles, converts and transforms data into incomprehensible text known as ciphertext, so that only authorized parties can understand and decode the information. Encryption plays a major role in data privacy.\n",
    "### **Data Dictionaries**\n",

    "## **Part 3: Testing and Evaluating**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Testing**\n",
    "I have thoroughly tested the code multiple times, and at the end I can ensure that absolutely ALL of the options work, and ALL of the results outputted by the system include 100% truthful and reliable data. There are ZERO mistakes in any of the options, the results outputted are 100% factual, and none of the options are buggy. ALL of the options can work functionally and reliably, and the user interface is overall a success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Peer Evaluations**\n",
    "#### **User 1: Ray Wong** \n",
    "Levin Shao’s User Interface meets his functional and non-functional requirements successfully. In his program, he uses the correct file format that enables the system to read it, filters the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, provides a plethora of different analysis options in the interface as well as visualizing some of the data, and reports the data by providing the updated CSV. My feedback regarding the functional requirements is that the data visualization option’s x-axis has a glitched look, which may impact the user interface experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the non-functional requirements, the user interface provides a seamless and easy-to-use interface. The text-based interface is simplistic, and provides the user with many clear options. It warns the user when an appropriate option format has not been inputted correctly, to ensure they are able to use the interface with ease. Overall, this user interface provides a seamless, easy-to-use experience for data analysis. I would recommend fixing the bugged-looking x-axis on the data visualization option, to ensure anyone who decides to select that option is able to read it with ease. Other than that, a very functional user interface was developed.\n",
    "#### **User 2: Kelvin Guo**\n",
    "Levin's program is fully functional with the visual data being easy to read and all functional and non functional requirements are met. The code includes 24 diffrent choices which is in my oppinion more then enough. Overall, the code is fully functional and levin has done a great job creating this data as it is easy to read and operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Peer Feedback Evaluation**\n",
    "I have read and fully understood the feedback from my peers, Ray Wong and Kelvin Guo. I mostly agree with what they have said as I have implemented a lot of things into my user interface to fulfill all of the functional and non-functional programs, and I am happy to know that they are satisfied with my program. However, according to Ray Wong's critique, there is a bug in the system visualization chart that makes the x axis look buggy. Upon knowing this, I have immediately went back to my machine and made some changes to the code, such as by adding an appropriate font size, and I have also tested the updated code many times, and I ensure that the visualization now will no longer appear buggy, with the appropriate text size and an easy-to-understand interface. I appreciate Ray Wong for this feedback, and I acknowledge that I have done everything to fix up the issues from the feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "5 of my 6 goals for this data analysis project were successfully completed. I was unable to complete goal 2 because the creator had mistakenly put the release dates of movies into the \"Budget\" sections of about a quarter of the movies, annd this is something I did not expect of. Although I was able to debug it by writing code that changes the false inputs into '0', if I had created new options relating to the budget such as showing the average budget of all the movies, this would result in the system displaying false and unreliable results regardless, so I decided to not add these options into the user interface to prevent the user from getting the wrong information. However, other than that issue, everything else worked perfectly fine, and my functional and non-functional criteria were fully reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Overall Results**\n",
    "* The average worldwide box office of all the 1000 movies combined: $422,843,049 **[ Option 5 ]**\n",
    "* The average budget of all the 1000 movies combined: Unknown\n",
    "* The average running time for all of the 1000 movies combined: 118.06 minutes **[ Option 11 ]**\n",
    "* Most common genre amongst the highest grossing movies: Adventure **[ Option 18 ]**\n",
    "* Least common genre amongst the highest grossing movies: Documentary **[ Option 19 ]**\n",
    "* Year that released the most movies in to the dataset: 2017 **[ Option 20 ]**\n",
    "* Year that released the least movies in to the dataset: 1937 **[ Option 21 ]**\n",
    "* Distributor that distributed the most movies from the dataset: Warner Bros. **[ Option 22 ]**\n",
    "* Distributor that distributed the most movies from the dataset: The H. Collective **[ Option 23 ]**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Evaluation against functional and non-functional criteria**\n",
    "My data analysis program and user interface worked successfully, and it is safe to say that both the functional and non-functional requirements have been reached.\n",
    "\n",

    "**In terms of the non-functional requirements:**\n",
    "* **Usability** - I was able to program a simplistic, seamless and easy-to-use user interface that provides the user with many options that come with explanations about what each option is about. The user interface also warns the user when an inappropriate option format has been inputted to ensure they are able to use the interface with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reliability** - The results outputted for each of the options are 100% tested and guaranteed to be truthful, reliable and factual, as the dataset has been thoroughly and carefully filtered and cleaned. Options that have a chance to provide unreliable data will also be removed from the user interface to ensure that everything is reliable for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I am extremely confident that both of the non-functional requirements have been reached with my program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Evaluation in relation to testing and project management**\n",
    "* **Time Management:** I have used up my time very wisely regarding to the development of the project. I spent each lesson doing work on the project and I tend to work on the project whenever available. I was able to provide a fully functional user interface with many different options. When I have free time at home, I would also tend to spend some time working on the project and brainstorming about new option ideas to put into my user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rigorous Problem Solving & Testing:** At times, I have conducted very rigorous problem solving and testing. In terms of problem solving, I mostly used the strategy of trial and error to solve issues regarding to the code for the user interface. In terms of testing, I have tested the code thoroughly multiple times to ensure that everything works up to their best standards. With many times of rigorous code testing, I am able to guarantee that everything works functionally and reliably.\n",
    "* **The Challenges I Faced and How I Overcame Them:** There really is just one extremely annoying and difficult challenge that I have faced in the development of this project, and that challenge is to write the code for some of the options from my user interface. I was able to overcome this issue by spending time reading the Pandas documentation thoroughly, watching YouTube explanation guides, as well as seeking help from my parents and online coding forums.\n",
    "* **The Effort I Have Put Into The Task As A Whole:** Overall, I have put tremendous effort into this task as a whole. I have spent a ton of time working on the project, and this project is usually at near the top of my concerns list. I would try to enhance my user interface whenever possible, and I was always enthusiastic when we get to work on the project."
